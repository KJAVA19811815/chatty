React Boilerplate
=====================

A minimal and light dev environment for ReactJS.

### Usage

Clone the boilerplate and create your own git repo.

```
git clone git@github.com:lighthouse-labs/react-simple-boilerplate.git
cd react-simple-boilerplate
git remote rm origin
git remote add origin [YOUR NEW REPOSITORY]
# Manually update your package.json file
```

Install the dependencies and start the server.

```
npm install
npm start
open http://localhost:3000
```

Extra stuff

The chatty server file is server.js and the server is the server.2.js, this is because
i put both files together and then i had to seperate them out.
### Static Files

You can store static files like images, fonts, etc in the `build` folder.

For example, if you copy a file called my_image.png into the build folder you can access it using `http://localhost:3000/build/my_image.png`.

### Linting

```
npm run lint
```
